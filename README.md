## Project Description

The Parlor Management System project focuses on creating a database system to efficiently manage a parlor's operations. It encompasses various aspects of the parlor, including employee data, customer records, payment transactions, service packages, appointments, invoices, and employee salaries. This project provides an opportunity to apply database design and management principles to a real-world scenario.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the Parlor Management System project are as follows:

1. **Data Organization:** Develop a structured database to organize and manage parlor-related data efficiently.

2. **Data Integrity:** Ensure data integrity and accuracy by defining relationships and constraints within the database.

3. **User Interaction:** Create an interface for employees and customers to interact with the database, enabling functionalities such as appointment booking, invoice generation, and payment processing.

4. **Business Logic:** Implement business logic for salary calculations and service package pricing.

5. **Report Generation:** Enable the generation of reports and insights from the data stored in the database.

## Database Structure

The database structure is fundamental to this project and includes the following key entities:

1. **Employees:** Contains information about parlor employees, including their employee ID, name, joining date, and phone numbers.

2. **Customers:** Stores customer details, including customer ID, name, address, and phone numbers.

3. **Payments:** Records payment transactions, such as payment ID, type, date, and amount.

4. **Service Packages:** Contains information about available service packages, including service ID and price.

5. **Appointments:** Records customer appointments, including appointment ID, date, and the type of service requested.

6. **Invoices:** Stores information about invoices generated for appointments, including invoice ID, service provided, and the invoice amount.

7. **Salaries:** Manages employee salaries, including salary ID, category, and amount.

## Entities and Relationships

Entities within the database are interconnected through relationships to maintain data consistency and integrity. For example, customers make appointments, leading to the generation of invoices. Employees receive salaries based on their categories. Various relationships exist among the entities to represent the parlor's operations.
